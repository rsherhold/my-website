This is a good course. 
I am making a change to this file directly on GitHub.
Another change. 
This is a change made after creating the branch example.
This is a change after adding the branch called "read".
This is a new change made locally to the branch after the read branch has been fetched and checked-out. Next, I will commit the channge and use a git push to update the branch read on GitHub.
